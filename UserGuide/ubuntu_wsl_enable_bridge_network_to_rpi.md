# Getting started

This userguide explain how to enable the `ubuntu wsl` connection for `ROS2` topic scan.
By default, `wsl ubuntu` is not exposed to external network. Therefore we run topic scan, we're unable
to find list of availabe `topic` in the network.

This is only one time procedure only. After you restart the `pc` you will have a problem to connect with 
the internet if you're `bridigin` the network using `Ethernet` connection.

In this tutorial, i'm going to show you step-by-step on how to bridge and expose the network connection using
computer `ethernet`.

## Step 1 - Enable Hyper-V manager.
This can be done by select and enable the feature. Click the box to turn the `Hyper-V manager`.
The restart your pc

## Step 2 - Run as an adminstrator of `Hyper-V manager` and open `Wsl ubunt` at the same time.
1. At this step you'll need to navigate to `Virtual Swith Manager`. 
2. From the list, you should observer `WSL` as well. In this case, the defaul network is `private` or `internal`.
3. Before we start with the briding. Please ensure our `Ethernet` adapter --> Properties --> Hyper-V Extensible Virtual switch
   is untick

4. Next, go to `Virtual Switch Manager` again and select `WSL` --> `External Type (Intel (R) Ethernet Connection) asfollow`. Then click apply.

5. At your `Network Connection` setting you should see new create `vEthernet(WSL)` connection as follow.

## Step 2- `wsl ubuntu` terminal configuration
1. Open your `wsl ubuntu`. By default, when you run `ifconfig` you should see defaul address start with `172.**`. We dont want this
   ip address. Therefore we need to change it to ensure it similar to our `Ethernet` network.
2. To do this, write following command
   ```
   sudo ip addr flush dev eth0
   sudo dhclient eth0

   Then run ifconfig --> You should ip address now has been changed to inet 192.168.8.181
   ```
   
   Next edit following file as follow
   ```
    sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
    Change nameserver to --> 8.8.8.8
